Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Attackers can change or tamper with the application's inputs to cause unintended behavior. Because anything entered
into the form by the user is actually read and used by the server, a malicious attacker could actually type code into 
the form (or insert a hyperlink directly, for example) and the server WILL execute it. 

The secure version of the code, we take the input that the person entered into the form and we make sure that
it is sanitized. This stops the malicious user from entering code into the form and having it run 
on the server. Sanitizing is essentially removing anything that could be interpreted as a script. 

Tampering violates the I in CIA. Integrity: guaranteeing that data remains unchanged and uncorrupted during storage,
transmission, or processing. Tampering clearly corrupts data, by inserting unwanted and unintended input, forcing the server
to act in an unintended way.
