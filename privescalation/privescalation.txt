vulnerability = you can freely upgrade or downgrade a user's status! There is no authenticating the user in the code.

any user who is not an admin is capable of downgrading the status of an admin! 
The problem is that we check the user's role, but an attacker could simulate that role to be anything. The attacker could take a brute force 
approach to keep checking until they validate the id. 

solutions: 
- we need some sort of authentication
    - through sessions, 
    - having login/registration page,
    - etc. 
- 2 factor authentication (vulnerability could be that you arent doing ENOUGH authentication!)

secure.js:
we check that the userid is part of a session or not, and there is middleware to create a (secret?) session ID that is assigned
