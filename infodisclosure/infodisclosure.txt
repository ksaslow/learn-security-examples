Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The vulnerability is that the code directly uses user-provided values in the query, and the user input is 
not sanitized. The attacker can hijack the parameter here and get the any information they want here.
Because we are using the variable "username" AS IS, the attacker can send it an executable query condition, rather than a string!

NOTE: the METHOD = tampering, the RESULT = information disclosure!

The secure version prevents the vulnerability by first sanitizing the input and making sure that any input resembling code or scripts
is removed. Any non-word or space is first removed from the string. 

The CIA property that information disclosuer violates is C: confidentiality, because an information disclosure attack allows unauthorized
individuals to access sensitice or confidential information, potentially leading to privacy breaches, data theft, 
or unauthorized access to systems or networks.

Additional security measures we can incorporate:
- we chould hash the stored passwords by using a hash algorithm (rather than storing plain text passwords)!
- or we could ensure that data in transit is also encryptyed (like using HTTPS)!
- we could make the cookies inaccessible so that the session ID or the cookies by using 2-factor authentication (example JWT tokens)!
    this ensures that the session is sent not in the cookies, but in the client's memory/state (this might be more directed towards spoofing though! )
