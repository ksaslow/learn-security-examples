Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

// NOTE: the METHOD = tampering, the RESULT = information disclosure!
// which security meausures can we incorporate: 
// - we chould hash the stored passwords by using a hash algorithm (rather than storing plain text passwords)!
// - or we could ensure that data in transit is also encryptyed (like using HTTPS)!
// - we could make the cookies inaccessible so that the session ID or the cookies by using 2-factor authentication (example JWT tokens)!
    this ensures that the session is sent not in the cookies, but in the client's memory/state (this might be more directed towards spoofing though! )
